# Spotify Clone üéµ

This project is a simple clone of the popular music streaming service, **Spotify**. It is built entirely using **HTML** and **CSS**, with a focus on recreating the UI design and layout of the platform. The project does not include any backend functionality or actual music streaming services but serves as a frontend visual replica of Spotify.

## Features ‚ú®

- **Navigation Bar**: Includes a fixed sidebar with links similar to Spotify's main navigation (Home, Search, Your Library).
- **Music Player UI**: A simple music player bar at the bottom mimicking Spotify's controls (play, pause, volume control, etc.).
- **Playlist & Album Views**: Grid layouts to showcase playlists and albums.
- **Hover Effects**: Interactive elements like hover effects on album covers and buttons to simulate the Spotify experience.

## Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è

- **HTML5**: For the structure and content of the web pages.
- **CSS3**: For styling the layout, colors, fonts, and animations.
